class MazeClause:
    '''
    Specifies a Propositional Logic Clause formatted specifically
    for the grid Pitsweeper problems. Clauses are a disjunction of
    MazePropositions (2-tuples of (symbol, location)) mapped to
    their negated status in the sentence.

    def __init__(self, props: Sequence[tuple]):
        """
        Constructs a new MazeClause from the given list of MazePropositions,
        which are thus assumed to be disjoined in the resulting clause (by
        definition of a clause). After checking that the resulting clause isn't
        valid (i.e., vacuously true, or logically equivalent to True), stores
        the resulting props mapped to their truth value in a dictionary.
        
        Example:
            The clause: P(1,1) v P(2,1) v ~P(1,2):
            MazeClause([
                (("P", (1, 1)), True), 
                (("P", (2, 1)), True),

            ])

                ("P", (2, 1)): True,
                ("P", (1, 2)): False
            }
        
        Parameters:
            props (Sequence[tuple]):
                A list of maze proposition tuples of the format:
                ((symbol, location), truth_val), e.g.
